# Team Logs

**Week 1:**
We forgot to make the team_log.md file, but we completed milestone 1 and met in person for roughly 5 hours. We would often at time during this section meet up to work on the code collaboratively on one device for example on the creation of the database section.

**Ruth:** Worked on editing the wellesley fresh api so that I would work more with our code and them commited that information to the repo. Then with the team we started to work on fixing the datetime issues that we ran into. Then we worked on having a json files and creating specific json files to display to the users.I then worked to create the streamlit file with yuneydy and then add the code to create a clander and display the date a user selects in streamlit. Also help to formulate our project timeline. 

**Yuneydy:** I created the streamlit.py file and separated it from our other file to make our code more organized overall. I also added dictionaries for the locations so we can properly search and display locations and meals using their ids. For our dataframe, we worked together to add it using streamlit functions and on how exactly we should display all the data we were searching for. Lastly, to add some more organization visually, we added the containers around the different filters we were searching by and submitted our last version

**Dianna:** I provided the starrer code to make requests to the Wellesley API that Ruth later edited to fit our app. I joined a bit late to the in-person meeting because I had to go to work, but I joined and helped with the dataframe issues we were having. 

**Week 2:**
4/8/25 - We met from 1-3pm to work on Milestone 2. We started working on a shared Google Doc to solidify our idea.

4/9/2025 - We met from 7-10pm to work on milestone 2. Where we finshed up our slide show. 

**Ruth:** I worked on formulating the the ACM ethics slide where we worked to think of various ideas such as wellbeing of students via various features. I also worked on creating the slide mock up section by displaying key features that we would like to show to the user and gave detailed break downs of what each button presented would add to our application. Overall we all where able to each add small section and corrections to the various other slides. By working on the slide mock ups on canva we where also able to formulate new ideas and features for our application in the process. I also create a google docs where we all worked on to track our progress throughout the assignment. 

**Yuneydy:** I worked mainly on our slides and creating my teams ER diagram. Throughout the time we worked together, I had to continuously update the ER diagram to the different different features we wanted to add and made sure to update relationships between tables. Additionally, I also created the logo for our project on Canva (Pending) to use across all of our app slides. On the slides, I helped set up the "Our Ideas" slides and make our presentation look visually pleasing, similar to a simple pitch deck.

**Dianna:** I worked on mostly on the key features and outlining the app so that Ruth could make a mock-up. I also created the rough outline of the contract, allowing the rest of the team to add more agreements that I may have missed. I also asked Crystal for help on the databases and relayed the information she gave me to Yuneydy, who was making the ER diagrams. I also reached out to El Table and got the contact information of the main person in charge.

**Week 2:**
4/14/25 - We met from 1-4pm to begin working on our final project, each working on a different aspect. Ruth worked on the Streamlit site, Yuneydy on the databases, and Dianna on the API calls.

4/16/25 - We met from 7-11pm to combine the work we did.

4/17/25 - We met once more from 11am-2pm to finally combine our work and finish our MVP.

**Ruth:**This week, I worked on several key parts of our application. I started by reviewing and implementing the professor’s code into my own. I helped build the dashboard and integrated Google authentication through the sidebar. I customized the sidebar using CSS and Streamlit Extras, uploaded images like the site logo, and created custom backgrounds to improve the app’s design. I built the landing page for the Wellesley Fresh section, letting users pick dining halls, meal times, and dates, and used Streamlit's session state to save their selections. I went to office hours to troubleshoot font and image issues and fixed them by creating an assets folder. With my team, I helped set up multiple pages so users could access different dining options. I created the user preferences popup and profile for the dashboard and added allergen editing to each page. Finally, I loaded CSV data for Cafe Hoop and El Table into the app in a clean, readable format and added the “Add Meal” button for the food journal feature. I then worked on displaying the data from wellesley fresh api with Dianna and made sure to add button funcationallty to each page that needed it.

**Yuneydy:**

**Dianna:** I worked on the API calls for our app. Firstly, I got the menus for Cafe Hoop and El Table, then added the names of the items and any ingredients listed to a csv. Then, I created code so that the Spoonacular API could fil in the calories, proteins, fats, carbs, and any other missing information. However, my code was very buggy at first, and I eventually ran out of API calls everyday. However, I did get to a point that I filled a good portion of the El Table data, and I will probably go to office hours this Sunday if I am still having problems getting the rest of the information. Though, I do think my code is correct for the most part. Additionally, I added the Wellesley Fresh API code to the streamlit so that it created a dataframe, and Ruth edited it so that it looked nice and had the "Add to journal" button. All of the information is now formatted so we can easily create data visualization, I just have to fix my code a little so that all the menus are filled.

**Week 3**

**Ruth:** I fixed layout bugs, improved the generate menu feature, and ensured accurate data display for Cafe Hoop and El Table using updated CSVs and API calls. I enhanced the filtering system for user preferences and added a search function for meals. I also refactored repetitive code into methods to improve readability and helped troubleshoot deployment issues with Dianna. Despite some challenges, I stayed focused and contributed to key features like the food journal and database visualizations, helping the team maintain steady progress. Then me and Diannna were able to work togethger to display user stat via the creation of various matplotlib grapgs. I was able to display theses graphs into streamlit an dmake it so they still followed the asthetics of our app. 

**Yuneydy:** I worked mainly on adding the database and adding the different tables we needed for our database. Because we had to continuously change them I had to reset and debig issues we would have when someone pulled and then kept the old version. Additionally, I made the create_user() function to add users into our database when they first log in and then added it into user profile creation as well as setting up the food log to only contain the values we would add to it. Once I had that completed, I also created a function for users to add allergens to their profile that would save into the database. Lastly, I made sure to add the user's id as their email so that it could be universally called more efficiently in the app.

**Dianna:** This week I continued with the Spoonacular API, as I was not content with my results from last week. I saved all the ingredients and dishes/drinks to a database sine El Table and Cafe Hoop used a lot of the same ingredients. Additionally, I used 'parseIngredients' instead of get ingredient info, as it was very hit or miss. 'parseIngredients' was much more reliable, so I remade the database and got estimates of all the dishes for their calories, fats, proteins, and carbs. It was very difficult and I had many failed attempts, but I think it was worth it in the end. Afterwards, I began working on the data visualizations and created code for 4 different kinds of graphs. It works well and uses our databases to make each graph for the user. I am very proud of the menus I made for El Table and Cafe Hoop, and the last thing we need to do with them is to combine it with the food_tracker.db so that it cna be properly added to the user's food journal. I also created the repos to deploy the app, but I worked with everyone in the group to actually deploy it since we were all a bit confused. 

**Week 4**

**Ruth:**This week, I worked on several features to enhance our app's functionality and user experience. I implemented a comment section for our rating feature, and developed the necessary Streamlit components to support it. I also fixed small bugs in the code, making sure that the app correctly displayed user data and improved its overall performance. I added a feature to track users' meals by displaying daily, weekly, and monthly data. Additionally, I focused on improving the meal display system by allowing users to search for meals in Café Hoop and El Table. I also made the interface more user-friendly by displaying ingredients and calories in markdown and allowing users to see their selections. I revamped the dashboard to show the user's favorite dining hall based on the time of day, ensuring that meal options were displayed accordingly. I organized the project files folders, and added a settings tab for better user customization. During the week, I worked closely with my team to address bugs, deploy the app, and add new features like displaying the top 5 rated meals. We also updated the app's theme settings and displayed meals that users loved. Despite facing some deployment challenges, the team maintained good communication and made solid progress on both functionality and design.

**Yuneydy:**

**Dianna:** This week I mainly focused on the data visualizations. It was interesting interacitng with the database to get all of the information, but I got the hang of it after a while. I made a lot of graphs, some of which I think turned out better than others. I am very proud of this radar graph I made that breaks down the nutrients by dining hall. I think the other main thing I did was help deploy the app. I made the public and private repos and deployed as much of the app as I could, then tried to fix the streamlit secrets and such. However, it was Ruth and Yuneydy who ended up asking for help on how to finally connect the database. Additionally, I helped fix some of the website since it was a bit hard to read at times. Then I helped Ruth with the final formatting of the app, as well as getting my friend's feedback for quick last-minute changes.
